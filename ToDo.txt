Allow FluidSim.c to create an windowed application where I could display some graphic
0. Set up openGL. Done
1. Pure graphic from code. Find how to the window sizes work. Done
2. Setup proper files: shader.cpp, fluidsim.cpp, etc. Done
3. Test: OpenGL for my purpose. Have empty background, shade in a decaying trace along the mouse. Done
4. Set up the simulation class. Start with a grid that corresponds to pixel display in openGL window. Clicking in some spot makes a change to the grid and display.
5. Make the grid update itself: diffuse
6. Formulas?

X. Test: Display some data supplied by a function(FluidSim)
X. Package everything needed to build necessary libraries that let any user on "any" platform do make/compile an executable.

Windows Installation:
GLFW 
  Download From Source
  
  Get CMAKE
    Download installer
  
  Build using CMAKE
  
  make installer -> creates /include and /lib files that gets included in Makefile. This is located in program Files X86
  -> installed

GLAD
  Download from site: select version, preferences

  Put glad's /include into GLFW's include files
  Put glad.c into project directorry
  Link all in Makefile
  -> Done

FluidSim.cpp, version that opens up a window and draw a triangle works.
OpenGL Tutorial: Enough Done
Shader + mouse input: get a working window that traces mouse trail.
